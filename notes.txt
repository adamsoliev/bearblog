ideas 
  build a seamless web of deserved trust with other people like you
  people buy stories
  do thing that only you can do
  anything worth doing is worth doing to excess
  you are easy to understand, hence easy to help
  don't lose your magic - say no for everything else
  most of us sabotage ourselves
  find simple idea and take seriously
  you and your work/mission
    maneuver yourself into an area that you are intensely interested
    build something that works for you - pick pieces, not whole
    you can't fight against your job; otherwise, you'll lose
    it feels "weight came off your shoulders"/extreme relief
    usually low introspection after mission is found (by default won't think of random stuff when wake up)
  spend all the time with handful of X (people, books, etc) who/that really matter
  seek out people who tell you truth
  go slow now to go faster later
  there is levels to people 
  we don't understand time (like decade)
  life is a sum of great individual days
  reciprocation tendency in humans is so pronounced
  things that you own start to own you
  do one thing and do it better than anybody else

ideas
  focus for long time is opposite of human nature, hence it is rare
  destroying ability to focus (long attention span) vs nurturing it 
  best 
    great takes time and that shows up in companies optimizing for growth (fail) vs durability (succeed) 
    durability often comes from mission - taking what they are doing seriously, obsession to every detail for a long time
    product-wise: obsessed with every detail
    marketing-wise: non-fiction marketing/tells story with full detail/heart/simplicity
    telent-wise: overpay, does anything to convince
  object of obsession is usually very simple rather than sexy new tech thing
  learning is changing your behavior (so keep things that change your behavior and quickly discard things that don't)
  mungerism
    sometimes scaling down and upping intensity, you get advantage
    fine simple idea and take it seriously
    in business, winning system goes ridicously far max/min one or few variables
  anything worth doing is worth doing for its own sake; reward for great work is more work --
  in so much hype nowadays, target is something that isn't work itself, it's some other thing (money, status, approval, etc)

  finding mission is biggest relief/feels like weight came off your shoulder
  most people are casual/don't have mission and that shows up all around us (products/services)
  people don't listen to themselves, hence don't find mission
